## Relationships between Research and Development, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Per Capita Emission

### Introduction

It is important to understand the relationships between Research and Development (R&D), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) per capita emissions, especially for policymakers working in the context of sustainable development. These three phenomena are interconnected and influence one another. R&D enhances innovation and efficiency, which positively affects economic growth. However, GDP growth often leads to higher energy consumption, resulting in increased CO2 per capita emissions. In this study, we aim to address questions such as how expenditure on R&D affects GDP growth and how GDP growth affects CO2 per capita emissions. This study is conducted as a project to fulfill the Experiential Learning Opportunity (ELO) of the Emerging Talent Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

## Project Overview

This project aims to holistically study the interconnections between expenditure on R&D and GDP growth, as well as the correlation between GDP growth and CO2 per capita emissions. To explore the latter, we used data from 173 countries, both developed and developing, spanning from 1960 to 2016. For examining the correlation between expenditure on R&D and GDP growth, we focused on 27 European countries from 2003 to 2022, based on data availability.

## Problem Statement

We aim to study how expenditure on R&D correlates with GDP growth and whether the percentage of GDP spent on R&D indicates anything about GDP growth, which is the cornerstone of an economy's performance. Additionally, we explore the relationship between GDP growth and CO2 per capita emissions. These are the main questions this study seeks to answer by using data from different countries around the world.

### Actionable Data Questions
A) is there any relationship between GDP growth and expenditure on R&D? if yes, to what extent? B) is there any relationship between GDP growth and CO2 per capita emission? 

### Data Analysis
For data analysis we have used Jupyter Notebook, and Pandas Library for data cleaning, preparing and analysis. For data visualization we have used Matplotlib Library.  
For technical analysis please see this [link.](https://github.com/dhossainali/MIT_ELO_Capstone_Project-/blob/a088f7025c962695270538cb91682164993660cd/Data%20Analysis/README.md)

### Conclusion

In the first case when we used expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP we obtain a moderate positive relationship between the two variables with correlation coefficient of 0.34 and in the second case where we used expenditure on R&D in exact amount we found that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables (GDP and expenditure on R&D) with correlation coefficient of 0.95.
Regression analysis also confirms these findings, for the first case R-Squared is low which is 0.11 and in second case R-Squared has improved significantly which is 0.9.
Furthermore based on the data there is a low level of positive correlation between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and carbon dioxide (CO2) per capita emission with correlation coefficient of 0.11.
