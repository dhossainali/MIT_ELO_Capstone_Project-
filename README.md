## Relationships between Research and Development, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Per Capita Emission

### Introduction

It is important to understand relationship between Research and Development, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Per Capita Emission specially for the policy makers who are working in the context of sustainable development. R&D enhance innovation and effeciency which further influence economic growth positively. While GDP growth leads to higher energy consumption which causes increase in CO2 per capit emission. In this study we aim to address questions like how expenditure on R&D affects GDP growth and have GDP affects CO2 per capita emission. 

## Project Overview

 We aim to find if there is any correlation between GDP growth and CO2 percapita emmission. And If there is any correlation between expenditure on R&D and GDP grwoth.

## Problem Statement

Our objective is to answer the questions of A) is there any relationship between GDP growth and expenditure on R&D? if yes, to what extent? B) is there any relationship between GDP growth and CO2 per capita emission?
