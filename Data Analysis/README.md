#### Techinical Analysis
In case of relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and expenditure on Research and Development (R&D) we consider two type data for expenditure on R&D, first we use expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP of an economy and second we use the exact amount of the expenditure on R&D to calculate the correlation. In the first case we obtain a moderate positive correlation between the two variables which is 0.34 and in the second case there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables (GDP and expenditure on R&D) which is 0.95. This big difference between the two is because the latter implies that economies with bigger GDPs have the tendency and resources to spend bigger amounts on R&D while still this expenditure might be a small proportion of their GDP.

Figure implies not a clear relationship between expenditure on R&D and GDP. Here we can see that some of the countries in some years have made two clusters of different positive relationships, one which is a strong positive relation and the other with weak positive relationship. It needs to be further examined on how to cluster based on the year and different countries and find out their common characteristics in order to draw a better conclusion. 
We leave this as another research question that can be studied rigorously.

Figure 2 indicates a strong clear positive relationship between GDP and expenditure on R&D as an exact amount. The relationship can go in both direction, in one hand greater GDP provide enough resources to be allocated for the R&D and on the other hand the amount spent on R&D is crucial for the innovation, technological advancement, and competitiveness which further influence GDP growth which is a major measure for the performance and health of an economy. 

Furthermore we ran linear regression on the data in order to see how the variables are explained by each other, we found a low R-Squared which is 0.11 that shows a low goodness of fit. The finding shows that only 11% of variability in GDP can be explained by the variability in expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP. While the R-Squared is significantly improved i.e. 0.9 when we use expenditure on R&D as an exact amount (the exact amount spent on R&D rather than calculating it as a proportion of GDP). The coefficient and intercept of the latter are 39.82 and 1.16 respectively.      

Based on the data  there is a low level of positive correlation between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and carbon dioxide (CO2) per capita emission i.e 0.11. Depicting visually by a scatter plot we see that there no trend is obvious in the figure.   This correlation is derived  by analyzing holistically by aggregating 173 different countries with different time spans ranging from 1960 to 2016. There might be some different result obtained if we disaggregate the countries by developed and developing countries and study them in different stages of their development trajectory, which is out of scope of this study. 

Figure 3 | Shows the scatter plot of GDP vrsus CO2 per capita emission.

Figure 3 shows no obvious relationship between GDP and CO2 per capita emission. Although intuitively it sounds that economies with greater GDPs use more energy that is based on fossil fuel, to produce more however, the data do not support this concept. 

Figure 4 | Shows the scatter plot of CO2 per capita emission over time (on year bases).

Although in figure 4 we do not see any obvious trend in CO2 per capita emission over time, however we can see that overtime there are more participants for which we do not have data in early years.  

Figure 5 | Shows the scatter plot of GDP over time (on year bases).

Figure 5 shows a clear positive trend in GDP overtime, it shows that we have more participants and also an expanding GDPs over time.
